# 3-Way-Financial-Modeling
This Excel workbook is a comprehensive financial forecasting and scenario analysis model designed to evaluate a business case. It integrates assumptions, forecasts, and financial statements into a single, dynamic system. There are assumptions that feed into multiple scenario simulations that test base, best, and worst outcomes.

The forecast structure automatically projects revenue, costs, and profits over time, linking directly to the three main financial statements — the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement — ensuring full consistency and reconciliation. Supporting schedules include depreciation, capital expenditure, taxes, working capital, debt and interest payments, and equity changes.

This model demonstrates professional-level financial modelling techniques, with clear logic flows and integrated links between drivers and results. It provides a practical framework for scenario testing, valuation, and cash flow planning.
